# OAS RAML Converter (CLI)

This package is a CLI wrapper designed to allow conversion between OAS / RAML specifications via a command line interface. This module uses (https://github.com/mulesoft/oas-raml-converter) under the hood so its very reliable. This package works across all platforms

## Installation

Install the module globally via Yarn or NPM:

### Yarn

    yarn global add oas-raml-converter-cli

### NPM

    npm install -g oas-raml-converter-cli

## Executing

To run the CLI utility do the following after installing:

1.  Start the utility via `oas-raml-converter-cli` in the console and you will see this:

```
Choose the type of converter you want to use (enter option 1-5):

1) RAML 0.8 > RAML 1.0
2) RAML 0.8 > OAS 2.0
3) RAML 1.0 > OAS 2.0
4) RAML 1.0 > OAS 3.0
5) OAS 2.0 > RAML 1.0

Enter now:
```

2.  After choosing your option select the source file (the utility will check if it exists before continuing):

```
Enter the source path of the file:
```

3.  Enter a destination path. If the folders do not exist the application will create them. Ensure you have adequate permissions for your folder:

```
Enter the destination path for the file:
```

4.  A final prompt before performing the conversion:

```
Are you sure you want to continue (y/n):
```

Thatâ€™s it! Your file should now be converted. You will be able to convert OAS to RAML and vice versa as many times as you like.
